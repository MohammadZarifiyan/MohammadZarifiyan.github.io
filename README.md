Sometimes you can take a loan from the bank and **invest** the received loan in another bank, for example, and you can receive the loan installments by the interest that accrues to your deposit in the other bank. This way you can make money without actually working.

I have created this website that calculates the final profit you can get from taking a loan from a bank.
